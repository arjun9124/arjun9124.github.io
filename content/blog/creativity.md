I operate in short bursts of either creativity or monotonity. Most days pass by in a haze, with nothing more than half-assed bullet journaling at best. Making of lists and plans, browsing the web and collecting trivial information while living walter mitty-esque fantasies of creative fulfilment. Sometimes these menial activities get caught up in an outburst of inspiration telling me to get busy and to get my hands tied in either making a creative fantasy come true or in committing to my state mandated monotony.
