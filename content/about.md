### Who am I ? 

I am Arjun. I live in Delhi, India. I am a student of Engineering. 

If you somehow found this website, then congratulations. In certain cases<sup>[1]</sup>, you may have received the URL from me. Normally you should have forgotten it. 

I'd appreciate if you read something. Even if you don't, or if nobody ever does, this place shall continue to exist on principle. According to google search console, if you lookup the term "arjun9124" this webpage is supposed to show up. At the time of writing, there is only one page on this "website" that is indexed by google search.

### The reason/s you are reading this are: 

- I keep this webpage up
- You accidentally strolled in here 
- You are cooler than the average person who never bothered to open this website

### What's the deal with this website ?

- It's [minimalist.](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) Or so it seems.
- It's my medium of self expression on the web.
- It's where I post my stuff, I don't have any social media accounts.


In case I have ceased to maintain this page, then feel sad that one interesting bit of internet is gone. 
> One broken GitHub pages repository for man is one giant leap for big tech

### I need a tld.
