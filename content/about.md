### Who am I ? 

I am Arjun. I live in Delhi, India. I am 8 credits away from being a Chemical Engineer. 

I'd appreciate if you read something. Even if you don't, or if nobody ever does, this place shall continue to exist on principle. 

### The reason/s you are reading this are: 

- I keep this webpage up
- You accidentally strolled in here 
- You are cooler than the average person who never bothered to open this website

### What's the deal with this website ?

- It's [minimalist.](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) Or so it seems.
- It's my medium of self expression on the web.
- It's where I post my stuff, I don't have any social media accounts.

In case I have ceased to maintain this page, then feel sad that one interesting bit of internet is gone. 
> One broken GitHub pages repository for man is one giant leap for big tech
