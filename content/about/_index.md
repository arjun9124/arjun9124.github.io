Hi, I am Arjun. I live in Delhi, India. I am currently in that awkward phase in life where you have finished two years in college and are trying to pivot yourself around a point to what you think is more feasible as a career option than whatever understanding of a career you had as a fresher/sophomore. I am a student of Engineering.  

## What's the deal with this website ?

* It's [minimalist.](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) Or so it seems. 

* It's my medium of self expression on the web.

* It's where I post my stuff, I don't have any social media accounts. 

## Contact

 You can find me at Quila Lal Kot every year on 23 September at around 1200 Hours.
