  <p>I haven&rsquo;t had an Instagram account for over a year, and even when I had one I rarely used it. Mostly people delete their social media accounts before their examinations, for me this was reversed as I deleted my account after the exams when everyone was remaking their own. Not keeping an Instagram account for me is more of a political statement than a social one. And I would like to illustrate this in the same passive aggressive fashion which seems to be becoming this blog&rsquo;s staple.</p>
