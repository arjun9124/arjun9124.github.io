  <p>Fuck it.
Its no point studying now. Its quite interesting that I&rsquo;ve appeared for the most difficult and challenging courses of my life with close to no preparation, and I am still expecting a good score.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s wrong in expecting though ? For mathematics I can still say, its a useful tool that will be required by me across all of my engineering. But the physics ? Oh really that is an entirely useless subject, or seems to be at least.  What is the point forcing everyone to learn something, when it may only be useful to a very specific few.  Fermi-Dirac, Maxwell-Boltzmann, I am familiar with these names. As for what they did I have no idea.  It was while watching a documentary on Oppenheimer I found the magnitude and the importance of their discoveries, while I still didn&rsquo;t really knew what they had done.</p>

<p>Letting these thoughts run loose. Winter depression, seasonal affective disorder, purposelessness. Whatever it may be. Let the thoughts be free. The old thoughts, because newer ones aren&rsquo;t coming.</p>
