      <description>Music, Mathematics and The Matrix&#xA;Earphones are like parasites. Parasites that crawl up your ear to disconnect you from the reality to hook you up to the fake world of digital entertainment stimulating your senses shielding you from the truth you are trying to run away from. Remember that old Moserbear advertisement ?&#xA;Don&#39;t like to think too much It makes me think too much It keeps my mind on my mind Don&#39;t want to see too much It makes me see too much Sometimes I&#39;d rather be blind Music itself is a very powerful thing.</description>
