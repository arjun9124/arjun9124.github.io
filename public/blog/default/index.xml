      <title>Unregulated</title>

      <description>I like to support the untaxed, unregulated part of the economy. I don&amp;rsquo;t haggle with Rikshawalas. They aren&amp;rsquo;t technically unregulated, they are self regulating. They are perfect order within the lack of order. Nobody decided their prices, nobody made their laws. They operate a thin plane above supply and demand. Ethics and regulations when they exist are based on their morality. They have license plates, but who&amp;rsquo;s checking ?! Even when anarchy befalls, banks, governments and their issued tokens become obsolete I bet Rikshawalas would still be roaming on their screeching whining rikshaws, charged with stolen electricity.</description>

      <description>Over the years, it has become increasingly hard to focus on the web. With websites and serveices now being designed to make you shuttle from one red dot to another, it has become necessary for us users to preserve our integrities as users and to not become consumers. This article will guide you to removing all sorts of distractions from YouTube, a popular video sharing website which houses a library of videos ranging from casual entertainment to perhaps the best lectures in calculus.</description>

      <title>Short Video Format</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/short-video-format/</link>

      <description>Against the short video format The short video format is a non consensual, habit forming, freedom infringing video format that destroys the users attention span. It takes away the users right to consent, delivers them trivial information in bite sized bits of novelty along with a hit of hormones.&#xA;The user while viewing this format loose all their freedom of choice, as videos scroll past them automatically without any decision making involved.</description>
